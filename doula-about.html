				<h2>Testimonials</h2>
				<p>
				   <i>"Cindy was a wonderful caregiver to our children but also served as a sounding board for Scott and I. She was sincereley concerned about not only the childrens' well-being, 
				   but ours as well. She guided us through all the information and allowed us to make choices in which we felt more confident because of the education she shared. She became a 
				   part of our family! The services have been invaluable and an investment we would recommend to any new parent."</i></p>
