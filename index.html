                  <h3>Cindy was a wonderful caregiver to our children but also served as a sounding board for Scott and I. She was sincerely concerned about not only the childrens' well-being, 
                   but ours as well. She guided us through all the information and allowed us to make choices in which we felt more confident because of the education she shared. She became a 
                   part of our family! The services have been invaluable and an investment we would recommend to any new parent.</h3>

                  <div class="item">
                  <h3>I wholeheartedly recommend Cindy MacKinnon. I had soldiered through the newborn period with my first set of twins with the battle scars and extreme sleep deprivation that comes with taking care of 2 newborns, including breastfeeding/pumping woes and a colicky baby. When I found out I was having a 2nd set of twins, I knew I had to do something different this time. Cindy was absolutely the answer! As I expected, I got some sleep this time around, and that enabled me to function & take care of my 2-year-old twins as well as the babies during the day.  But here is what I didn't count on: that Cindy would be a friend through all the troubles and worries & hormones.  That she would often text me to check on me on the days she wasn't there (and even on the days when she was coming that night). That she would spend her off-the-clock time answering emails/questions. That she would be a great listener when I had the struggles with my parents/family-helpers that inevitably come with the stresses of caring for 2 babies. That I would not feel alone. That I would feel like I had a knowledgeable advisor to answer all my questions of "what should I do?" and "am I doing the right thing here?" That I would have someone to talk me off the ledge when I over-worried.  That she would even offer helpful advice and tips before the babies were born. These are the benefits I never dreamed of. Cindy comes in and patiently listens, answers your questions, and ensures that you get the sleep you need, and is right there in the trenches with you whenever you're worried. The other important feature that sets Cindy apart is the flexibility she offers in how you use the hours you contract her for. If you find you need her only 1 night a week one week, but 2 or 3 another, or a day shift and a night or 2 another week, she is so accomodating and flexible. That is absolutely invaluable, because you can really concentrate her services for when you need them. Cindy is a gem!</h3>

                  <div class="item">
                  <h3>Cindy is AMAZING!  My husband and I have 2 boys ages 6 and 3 so when we discovered we were pregnant with twins we knew we needed help at night. Cindy came recommended by a friend so we interviewed her and quickly discovered how valuable she would be once our twins arrived. Cindy's unique ability to blend right into the family along with her level of expertise of newborns and multiples gave us a sense of comfort and relief. She offered understanding, support, encouragement and advice when needed. Cindy is very professional yet talking with her feels a lot like catching up with an old friend. She made surviving those first several weeks with our twin boys possible and more enjoyable as we were able to get much needed sleep. My husband and I are so grateful for her services and would recommend her over and over again.</h3>
